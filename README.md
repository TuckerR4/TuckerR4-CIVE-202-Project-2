This includes files for Project #2 CIVE 202 for Group 14
Description:
This project automates the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT) concrete mix design process by translating the logic from the NDOT Excel “Mix Design” worksheet into a Python-based system.

Instead of manually entering values into Excel, this program guides the user through a step-by-step input process and automatically generates a final weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete.

The goal of this project is to improve transparency, repeatability, and reliability in the mix design process by using structured Python functions.
